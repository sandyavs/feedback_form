# Feedback Form For Survey
## Description
This project implements a user feedback form using React functional components with state management powered by the useState hook. The form captures essential user inputs such as name, email, and feedback message, and includes robust validation logic to ensure data completeness and integrity.

## Learning Objectives
- Create a form to collect user feedback, including their name, email, and the feedback message.
- Handle form submission, including data validation, to ensure that the users enter their names and provide feedback before submitting the form.
- Display a confirmation dialog to users after they submit their feedback, showing the information they entered and prompting them to confirm before final submission.
- Reset the form fields to clear the input values and provide users with a clean form for submitting additional feedback.
